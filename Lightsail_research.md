### <a name='WhatisLightsail'></a>What is Lightsail?
- Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS if you just need virtual private servers. Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly – a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP – for a low, predictable price. You manage those Lightsail servers through the Lightsail console or by using the API or command-line interface (CLI).

## <a name='whatisVPS'></a>what is VPS?
![vps.png](./Pictures/vps.png)
1. A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine (VM) that runs its own copy of an operating system (OS), and customers may have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. For many purposes, they are functionally equivalent to a dedicated physical server, and being software-defined, are able to be much more easily created and configured. They are priced much lower than an equivalent physical server, but as they share the underlying physical hardware with other VPSs, performance may be lower, and may depend on the workload of other instances on the same hardware node.
2. type of VPS: Managed VPS and Unmanaged VPS
- Managed VPS: It allows its clients to worry much about "what" rather than "how" of managing the resources required in a full-scaled front-end application. This VPS can come along with AWS to manage the abstract laying infrastructure needed for a job or set of tasks a user wants to execute on VPS.S
- Unmanaged VPS: This allows the VPS to carry out a simple hosting experience where the client is responsible for managing all the tasks like configuring it, installing and updating the software.
